We need select useful data from csv, which is raw data.
the CSV files are raw data. There is rarely a simple one-to-one mapping from raw data to a schema. Some raw data contains noise. Some raw data is superfluous. Some raw data may need to be reformatted or filtered prior to importing. Part of the assignment is developing a strategy to map the raw data onto the schema. Not all raw data will be needed and may be discarded (but you may choose to use it).
